Consequentialist moral theories locate the good in the consequences of our
actions. Naively, we might think that this then removes any sensible way of
juding *persons* - the only thing that matters is what they do, after all. But
that's simplistic. After all, our personal qualities affect how we act.

A simple notion of consequentialist "moral character" could be defined like
this:

> X is has good (bad) moral character in proportion to the worth of the actions
that they tend to perform.

I've worded that so it's going to admit of degrees - as good consequentialists,
we want to say that the person whoe saves a 1000 lives once a year has
a better character than the person who saves one life a day.

Like all dispositional analyses, this is very sensitive to the situation. Exactly
which characteristics are helpful for someone to be "good to have on your side"
depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Someone who is skilled at heroic
feats of valour (and inclined to perform them) might be who you want in a fight; 
but if you're managing a large organization, you might rather have someone who 
was inclined to do the filing.[^monotonic]

[^monotonic]: It's tempting to think that different circumstances simply require
    different "virtues", and that we can nonetheless imagine a "perfect"
    person who possessed all the virtues and thus had the correct disposition
    for all situations. But I think it's pretty easy to come up with situations
    where any putative "virtue" was actually morally counterproductive, and
    hence, by our definition, not conducive to good moral character in that
    situation.

The same is true of moral character. Today's world is very different from
historical conditions, and the kind of person who will likely do the most good
today may be quite different from the historical norm. 200 years ago it was
difficult to have global effects, and power/wealth was less unequally
distributed. A peasant with good moral character would probably help his neighbours,
be kind to those he met, and generally be what we traditionally think of as a
"good" person.[^traditional]

[^traditional]: Where I refer to "traditional" moral character, I mean whatever
    dispositions would have led to good actions in a traditional setting. This
    doesn't necessarily align with what has traditionally been *thought* to be
    good character. Chastity, for example, was probably never very helpful.

However, if we think that the effective altruists are on to something, then good
moral character for today's world might be quite different. It might even be
different between *parts* of today's world, since EA argments derive a lot of
their bite from the fact that we in the West are so (comparatively) wealthy. The opportunties that
are available to us are not available everywhere, and hence the characteristics
that are required for us to take advantage of them may not be as important elsewhere. While selflessness
and empathy are likely to always be a part of the package, good moral character
in today's West arguably requires hard-headed thinking and analytical tendencies
more than anything.

The situation-dependence of moral character is a bit disquieting. Even if you 
are a "good" person for today, there are
situations where the qualities that make you good would be at best irrelevant and
at worst actively harmful. The classic example of moral luck highlights this
problem: if you were transported to Nazi Germany, would you be a
good person there? If you're a law-abiding individual, that's probably a useful
disposition today, but as history has taught us, a tendency to conformity can be 
very dangerous in the wrong circumstances.

Objectively, the truth is clear: your character can only be good or bad in
relation to the circumstances in which you find yourself. If you worry about
whether you have an "absolutely" good or bad character, you can try and
reason about how prevalent the circumstances which you are suited for would be
across your lifetime (or all time). I'm not sure that there's
really a worthwhile question there, but it does feel emotionally compelling.

From my point of view, I'm (hopefully) doing quite a lot of good through my 
donations, and I think that the chances of me reaching this course of action given the
circumstances in which I've lived are pretty high. Therefore I think I'm doing
okay at "modern" moral character; but thinking of it in "traditional" terms,
I'm pretty average. I can be quite selfish; I do little direct volunteering; 
I'm nice to people but I don't think I make as much difference in their lives 
as I could.

That makes me feel like I'm the beneficiary of some moral luck myself - the
majority of the good I expect to do in my life is due to the opportunities
existing and being noticeable by people like me. Drop me in the 15th century and
I'd be pretty useless.[^peasant] But it may be that current conditions are going
to become "business as ususal" from here on. Unless globalization goes
backwards, or we get *all* the low-hanging fruit, I'd expect the future to be
much more like today than like the 15th century. So it may be that our moral
intuitions of what constitutes good character will just take a while to adjust
to the world we live in. This doesn't mean that features of "traditional" moral character
are irrelevant. They're largely still likely to make you do more good things,
but we should focus our personal development on those that have the biggest
impact in the modern situation.[^effective]

[^peasant]: Ask anyone, they'll tell you I'd make a terrible peasant.

[^effective]: We might call this "effective character".

Regardless, I'm glad I live in a time that suits my character!
