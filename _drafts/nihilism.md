This post contains a higher concentration of things that actually scare me than
anything I think I've ever written.

I'm going to use the word "nihilism" a lot in this essay, so I'm going to do
that annoying philosopher thing and define a couple of variants straight up:
- Philosophical nihilism: nothing has moral value (it doesn't matter whether
  this is because the concept is incoherent or just never instantiated)
- Personal nihilism: nothing has value *to me*.

These are related, but distinct. A philosophical nihilist might be a merry
hedonist; whereas a personal nihilist might glumly declare that humanity is
tremendously valuable, but they just can't bring themselves to care.

Philosophical nihilism is Mad Max, personal nihilism is crushing society-wide
ennui. 

Note that personal nihilism is *not* selfishness, it's not even caring about
yourself. Nor is it depression, although depressed people often come closer to it.

Historically, philosophical nihilism has been regarded as the scary one, but I
think personal nihilism is much scarier, and we are well on our way towards an epidemic.

## Why is personal nihilism bad?

I don't think anyone is a true personal
nihilist - or if they are, they would die quickly. Rather it is a spectrum, and
it's just a question of how much it taints us.

Personal nihilism says: "why bother doing this?" Just about everything.

To be clear: if we become too personally nihilistic we will die. Individually,
as a society, as a species. It is, fundamentally, anti-life. If we want to keep
on living, drastic measures may be needed.

Personal nihilism is perhaps Nietzsche's true enemy - his particular claim is
that we may need to believe some *false* things in order to escape it:

>The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here,
>perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far
>an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps
>species-rearing ... -- *Beyond Good and Evil*, 1.4

## Where does personal nihilism come from?

One obvious source of personal nihilism is philosophical nihilism. If a primary
motivation in your life is moral, then coming to believe that nothing is
