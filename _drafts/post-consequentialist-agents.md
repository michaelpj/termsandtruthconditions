John cares about nothing but making the most amount of money that he can.
He comes to believe that the best way to do this is to start a new company, but
also that companies are most likely to succeed when the founder is intrinsically
motivated by the work of the company. So John immerses himself in a domain and
cultivates an interest. When he finally starts his company, he does it out of a
genuine obsession with the idea. He is successful and makes a lot of money.

This is a prosaic example of an agent modifying themselves to the point at which
they are not longer explicitly pursuing their original goals (although the idea
is to achieve them nonetheless). Before immersing himself in his field, John1
primarily pursues money. Afterwards, John2 primarily pursues his startup idea,
and is willing to sacrifice monetary opportunities to work on it.
