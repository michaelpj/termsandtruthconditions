# Introduction and warning

There are a number of consequences of effective altruist philosophy that are conducive to *despair*.

We talk about our despair in hushed tones, often in the context of how to *avoid* feeling this way, or when presenting alternative pictures that don't generate so much despair. 
Often we assume that the paths that lead to despair are so obvious (and they mostly are) that there's no need to write them down.

Well, I want to put the monster in the spotlight. 
Let us know our enemy. 
Leaving the arguments implicit risks us either under- or over-estimating their strength.

Hence, a warning: if having read this introduction you think this post will make you feel bad, you are probably right. 
It makes me feel bad. 
Consider not reading it.

## The horror of opportunity cost

Opportunity cost stems from the observation that whatever we choose to do is
also a choice *not* to do all the other things we could have done. That includes
inaction, which is equally a choice not to act.

Whenever we do something we therefore pay the *cost* of not doing any of those
other possible actions. If you go to the party you can't also have a
relaxing night in. If you buy a car you can't also have the return on investing
the money. 

Today, we have many opportunities to do good with our time and money.
Unfortunately (for us) this means that we have much *higher* opportunity costs
for many of our other actions than has been typical in the past. If you buy a
coffee you can't also buy a bednet with that money.[^act-omission]

[^act-omission]: Some ethical theories hold that there is a difference between
    doing something and allowing something to happen (the "act-omision"
    distinction). I think this is silly -- the people end up dead either way --
    but if you believe it then that might help you feel better about this.

This can put an unbearable pressure on our decisions about how we spend our time
and money. Choosing anything other than to devote the maximum amount of
resources to doing good seems
[monstrous](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/free-hugs) 
(this is the "demandingness" objection to effective altruism and
consequentialism more generally).

## There is no "later"

The counterfactual reasoning that leads us to opportunity cost also points to
an argument that almost everything is always urgent.

Suppose that we discover a cure for 

An asteroid is heading for collision with Earth. In scenario A we manage to
deflect it at the last possible moment, whereas in scenario B we manage to
deflect it a year earlier. In one way there is no difference here - in both
cases we succeeded before the threshold time that we needed to, but scenario A
clearly carries more *risk* - both of delay beforehand (leading to failure) or
of failure in the event without extra time to recover. Such increased risks from
delay are often less visible but can be very relevant.

# Some potential routes out

## "Excited altruism"

[Excited altuism](https://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/) asks
us to make a perspective switch. Instead of feeling dismayed at all there is to
do, we should be invigorated by our unprecedented progress in tackling them and
our opportunities to do more.

I think this is a coherent approach, but I cannot bring myself to feel that way.
Prioritization has often been compared to medical triage. Imagine a 
triage doctor saying "How wonderful it is that we are here! We have an amazing
opportunity to save people who would otherwise have died!". They wouldn't be
*wrong* pe se, but I find it hard to feel that way.

## Comparative advantage

In economics, a person A has a *comparative advantage* at doing X if they can do X
at a lower cost than anyone else. The key modifier here is lower *cost*. Even if
they are overall less efficient at doing X than B, it may cost less for A to do
X if B has other high-value opportunities they could be doing instead.

Comparative advantage suggests that it is more efficient for people to focus on
what they are most skilled at, even for people who are high-skilled in several areas.
In particular, when we look at an individual it may seem that they are taking an
action with a high opportunity cost, but this may not be so if we consider them
as part of a group which is *collectively* maximizing their outcomes.

However, there are two key ways this fails to save us.

Firstly, we usually have the option of doing *more*. Do what you're doing but
smarter, faster, harder, longer. Work Saturdays. Read relevant material in your
spare time. Give more.

There is no comparative advantage here because we are not trading off between
two outputs which we want both of, we are choosing between X and *more of* X.

Secondly, our output efficiencies are not fixed. That is, people can change. You
may be no good at AI research now (or leadership, or selling, or outreach, or
...), but you could invest some work in *becoming better* at that. Which might
mean you should work on something else, which might mean fewer people die.

## Psychological realism

Imagine our self-interested businessman again. Suppose that his only goal is to
make the most money that he can over the course of his life. What advice would
we give him? 

Would it be "always work more"? No - we know what happens if humans do that,
they burn out. That might be good advice for a robot, but for a human it is
simply bad strategy.

However, to be cheerful about this would be to have a [missing
mood](http://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html). To be
forced by one's nature to do much less than is needful is no cause for cheer,
but rather bitter disappointment. The world needs angels (or perhaps Friendly
AI), and all it has is us.

Furthermore, even psychological realism does not free us entirely. We could
still be improving *ourselves* to lift or at least weaken the restrictions that
prevent us from doing more. Yes, that means we must work hard to make ourselves
capable of bearing even more work.

## Heroism

Heroism rejects pyschological realism as defeatism. We are capable of better.

The burden of self improvement becomes [tsuyoku nariai](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoLQN5ryZ9XkZjq5h/tsuyoku-naritai-i-want-to-become-stronger).

The  [shut up and do the impossible](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nCvvhFBaayaXyuBiD/shut-up-and-do-the-impossible).

We can take the Utopain oath:[^tears]
> I hereby renounce the right to complacency, and vow lifelong to take only what
> minimum of leisure is necessary to my productivity, viewing health, happiness, 
> rest, and play as means, not ends, and that, while Utopia provides my needs, 
> I will commit the full produce of my labors to our collective effort to redirect 
> the path of human life away from death and towards the stars.

[tears]: Reading the Utopian oath makes me tear up. I don't think that's surprising:
    it's a rich evocation of the desires and tensions I've been talking about and
    which I -- and perhaps you, dear reader -- am particularly emotionally
    vulnerable to.

I find this (romanticised) depiction of heroism hard to even think about, as
though it emitted a bright light. And yet, it *is* romanticised. In the end,
what it amounts to is somehow overcoming pyschological realism.

I applaud those who manage to take this path, although I suspect that many who I
regard as heroic in this respect suffer just as much from feelings of inadequacy
- there is always more to do.

# A conclusion of sorts

I find the intellectual and emotional case for despair pretty compelling. None
of the solutions seem adequate to me.

I often feel despair. My solution thus far is psychological realism, and it
helps somewhat. I still give away plenty of money, and try to give more each
year. So it's not a dead loss.

I hope that we can do better in the future.
