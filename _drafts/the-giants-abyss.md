title: The Giants' Abyss
---

The Abyss was first recognized in the notes of Robin and Macie Donnelly, two Scottish holidaymakers and amateur occultists.
Robin had taken to writing extensive dream diaries, and when Macie remarked by chance on the strange dream she had had since arriving in Bushmills, he seized the opportunity for a piece of comparative oneirology.
What struck him about Macie's dream was that it exactly mirrored a dream of his own, but only part.
So he quickly stopped her and the two independently wrote out the record of their dreams.

The results were ambiguous.
Both had found themselves in a canyon, what the two eventually decided was an inversion of the monolithic causeway that straddles the sea nearby.
The canyon itself is shrouded in darkness, but the walls -- the walls draw the eye and the (ethereal) hand.
The prismatic pillars of the abyss shine with refracted light from no source.
Their hexagonal (or heptagonal -- a debate of much vigor amongst later scholars) forms
