Hi all!

I'm Michael Peyton Jones, and this is my blog. I'm planning to use it for a variety of stuff, but I'm also going to be using it as a way to keep people up to date with what I'm doing in Australia. If that's you, then you can get a feed that will just get you those posts by clicking [this link](/blog/categories/australia/atom.xml). If you'd like to subscribe by email instead, then use [this link](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=AustraliaTermsAndTruthConditions&amp;loc=en_US) to do that. If you're willing to take the risk of being subscribed to the whole blog (warning: probably irregular and inconsistent content!), then there's a RSS link in the navigation bar.
