Another year has come and gone with no activity on this blog - but things will
be different this year. A new domain, a new theme, but this time with more content!

<!-- more -->

I'm not much of a believer in vague goals with nothing backing them up, so I'm
Beeminding this to the tune of one post a week. For bonus public shaming, I've
put a little widget showing the Beeminder graph down in the footer. Of course,
this post counts, so that gives me a week of leeway...

I also came across [this](http://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/) rather wonderful
template for doing a thorough year-end review. That's something that I've always
meant to do properly, and I've taken this opportunity to really go for it. I'm
not going to post it it's entirety (these things are a bit private), but I'll 
probably write another post soon (2 down!) about my goals for 2015.
