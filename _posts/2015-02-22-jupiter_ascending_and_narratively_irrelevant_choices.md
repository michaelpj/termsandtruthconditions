*[Content warning: spoilers]*

So... Jupiter Ascending is pretty crap.

I say that as someone who is quite willing to take a ridiculous action film for
what it is. Sometimes I go to see a film for the special effects, and I
understand that the paper-thin plot is just window-dressing for some really
large explosions. But Jupiter Ascending somehow manages to not even clear that
bar.

The explosions are certainly pretty, and there are some moments where the art
design is truly stunning (I'm thinking of the wedding scene in particular), but
the pieces are put together clunkily, and the dialogue is truly appalling.
Particularly the dialogue between Jupiter and wolf-man (I can't even remember
his name) - there was at least one point where I *believe* she was trying to
chat him up, but it certainly wasn't obvious. 

The film is also notable for having the protagonist fall off tall buildings with
remarkable frequency. This allows wolf-man to catch her with his magical flying
roller-skates.[^bollocks]

[^bollocks]: They "harness the power of gravity by redirecting it into
    differential equation slips", apparently. Admittedly, that is the worst bit of
    techno-bollocks in the film, mostly it doesn't even try.

However, one thing that JA does do reasonably well is giving Jupiter some amount
of agency. The plot doesn't make this terribly easy, since she's essentially
being swished around from baddie to baddie like a cosmic hockey puck, but she
does get to make a few choices. I can think of three that matter:

- She chooses to marry Titus
- She chooses to talk to Belem, over wolf-man's protests
- She chooses to save Earth rather than her family

I think the third is especially interesting, because it's really a moral choice.
Save the Earth, or stop your family being turned into fancy anti-wrinkle cream? 
Even Holywood is consequentialist enough to know what you ought to do there, 
and she does make the right choice.[^notreally]

[^notreally]: Let's ignore the fact that it's clear to the viewers that if she
    "saves" her family, they'll all be put back on Earth and harvested
    immediately. That's just a sop so the audience don't feel discomfited by an
    actual moral dilemma.

But the thing is, we (the audience) know that this choice doesn't matter. In
this kind of film, there is no way that we're going to kill either the
protagonist's innocent family *or* everyone on earth. That's just not how it
goes. We *know* that somehow we will get both good outcomes.

Megadeath and the slaughter of innocent minor characters are not on the list of
Allowed Consequences for protagonist's actions (or at least not without major
foreshadowing), but the death of another protagonist is. So that means that
wolf-man's antics actually have *more* narrative tension, from an audience
point of view, because we believe that Jupiter might die in this story. We don't
believe that the Earth might get destroyed, so while it's kind of interesting
what choice Jupiter makes, we know it'll all be okay in the end. 

Now, this doesn't damage Jupiter the character's agency if we look at it from
inside the story. But I wouldn't be surprised if she's *percieved* as having
less agency than wolf-man, even though she has much bigger choices.[^neutral] We
have a whole load of meta-narrative information, which means that those
choices don't inspire much narrative tension, and so don't seem as
important.

[^neutral]: This isn't *specifically* a gender thing - there are plenty of men
    in films who get narratively irrelevant choices where we know that neither
    option is acceptable.
