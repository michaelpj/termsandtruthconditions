Thanks to the folks at [Charity Science] I'm now helping out with
donation matches. There's a fair bit of evidence that this encourages
people to give more[^evidence] - and if you're planning to give 
already, it can be a good way to increase the impact of your donations!

[^evidence]: 
    See [here](http://www.charityscience.com/operations-details/the-power-of-donation-matching)
    for a positive take, and [here](http://www.benkuhn.net/matching) for 
    a somewhat more sceptical discussion. Regardless, the effect appears 
    likely to at least be positive!

My first chunk is Â£2000 towards a [fundraiser](https://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=7019)
for AMF that's being doubled by Allan Saldanha, and then doubled again by Charity
Science, of which my contribution is part.

Sadly, it's closed now, so I can't encourage you to donate, but if you're 
a regular donor, you might consider participating in donation matches to make
your contributions go a little bit further.
