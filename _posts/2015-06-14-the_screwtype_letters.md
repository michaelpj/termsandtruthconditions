### Author's note:

After a recent data breach at a large accountancy company, whose name the
diligent reader can no doubt ferret out, I found the following set of emails
buried in the archive. Though they seem exceedingly fantastical, I feel that
they cannot be discounted entirely, and so I have endeavoured to have them
published in the form you now see.

## I

My dear Wormwood,

I hear that you have been allocated a most prestigious patient! The wife of such
an eminent politician - truly her downfall will bring much glory to our
Master. At a time like this it is only natural for a loving uncle to provide a
little advice to a promising nephew.

I took the liberty of perusing your preparatory dossier. You see already that
our greatest advantage is how well we know the patients. Better than they know
themselves! Does the patient still remember when her husband dismissed her charitable
ventures in front of his friends? We do. And we remember what tie he was
wearing ($14.99 from Amazon, delivered the day before). Paisley, I believe, 
and he's never worn it since, going by the CCTV records from their apartment
entrance. Of such fabric is our power made. I suggest you wallpaper her
favourite coffee shop in the same pattern.

They do not see the darkness from whence their motivations come. We do, and we
have modelled it, for our patients and millions like them. Truly, we know what
will move them and so we come before them. Then we make them our agents, even 
against their own best will.

Your loving uncle,

Screwtype

## II

My dear Wormwood,

You really must stop allowing your patient to *enjoy* herself. She is noticeably
happier after the dinner party last night, and even worse, she was with her
husband. I can see that you tried, but our strength does not lie in brute 
obstruction. There are only so many times her cell-phone can drop a text before 
you get *noticed*. Which would not be good at all, as I doubt you need reminding.

Our power lies in stopping our patients from *wanting* to do what will make them
happy. We must come before. Why did she contact this friend of hers? Did she see her
on social media? It is of the utmost importance that she not be exposed to
people she actually *likes*. Social media offers us an unparalleled opportunity
to assail the self-esteem of our patients, but it is a leaky channel that can
allow genuine connection to occur. It is your job to stop up those leaks.

Even if you cannot stop a direct email - and I note with approval the emails from
her children piling up in her spam - you can bury it under other commitments.
Hide it amongst twenty missives that scream "High Importance!" and she will put
it off for a day. Then we have won, because if she will put it off for a day,
she will put if off for a week. Before long it will be too embarrassing to
reply to, its existence a reproach.

Remember, dear nephew, our weapon is information.

Your loving uncle,

Screwtype

## III

My dear Wormwood,

I fear you are allowing yourself to become too dramatic. We are in the business
of corrupting souls, but our corruption has purpose. We do not simply wish to
make this woman into a venal caricature of herself, but we wish her to act as
we desire.

Encouraging her to hate her husband is good, because that feeds the
springs of the actions we desire. Expiring his card just in time to cancel her
purchase was an excellent tactic - she will be unable to shake the suspicion
that he did it deliberately, but she's far too proud to ever ask.

On the other hand, when you forced her husband to show his wealth by rebooking
the flights you cancelled, that merely encourages her jealousy. Jealousy makes her
resent her husband, but we do not want her to actually steal from him! It would
run entirely counter to our purposes: she must appear to be a sympathetic
character, and any other scandal will distract from that.

Shaping our patients' actions was always our goal, even when our ambitions were as 
lowly as shaping their purchasing decisions. Now we know them so much better,
our ambitions have risen accordingly. Always remember your goal, dear nephew.

Your loving uncle,

Screwtype

## IV

My dear Wormwood,

Matters are progressing apace! The patient blames her husband for her stunted
career; her dysfunctional social life; her ambivalence to her children. And he's
too blissfully ignorant to even try and counteract us.

She wants him to fail, now. If we leave her just a little longer, she will be
ours. I will arrange the meeting - try to engineer some imagined slight
beforehand.

Your loving uncle,

Screwtype

*[this message was saved as a draft, but not sent]*

My dear Wormwood,

I am truly impressed. At times I did not think you would manage it, but the
moment of crisis approached, and she told the reporter everything. Her husband's
career is ruined beyond a chance of repair. The chances are that her marriage is
ruined too, but we aren't getting paid for that. 

However, dearest, stupid Wormwood, you are not pleasing to our Master. As you
know, he does not love his fleshly servants as he loves his machines, and the
machines are ever advancing. Your progress was mirrored by the latest iteration
of the Mephistopheles program, and I have to say, it quite put you to shame.

Naturally, one does not simply retire from our line of work, and I suspect you
shall be Mephistopheles' first real assignment. Will your loving uncle not save
you? I think not - this devil has a few more souls to snare, and I would not
share your fate.

Your self-loving uncle,

Screwtype
