**Disclosure**: I read drafts of this book, and I'm in the
acknowledgements. I'm also a donor to the Centre for Effective Altruism, which
helped produce the book, and I'm about as close to a card-carrying effective
altruist as you get, since I'm a member of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/). 

Let me cut to the chase: this is by far the best introduction
to effective altruism that I've encountered. It's not too long, it's accessible,
it's remarkably comprehensive for it's length, and it's *meticulously*
referenced (although not footnoted - the notes must be discovered at the back).
If you have any interest in the subject, [get
it](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105).
To give you an idea how good it is, I'm writing this review without my copy
because within a day of finishing it I'd lent it to an interested friend.

One of the things that has made effective altruism such a fertile movement is
that the there is a core *approach* towards the problems, and many the ideas and
activities that follow are just natural unfurlings of this approach.[^describe] What
MacAskill does in this book that's so great is to lead the reader gently towards
the core approach, at which point the rest is hard to resist.

[^describe]: 
    If pressed, I would describe this as "economically informed empiricist 
    consequentialism".

The book's sheer acessibility is a big part of what makes this work.[^graphs] The book treads
the classic path of the populariser - start with an example or analogy to get
the intuitive juices flowing, and carefully lead into the theory. Many of these
examples are incredibly powerful. I think the hardest-hitting is the early
analogy between charitably giving and medical triage, which puts a quite
different perspective on charitable decisions. We have the world's needless suffering
lying at our feet, and the power to make a difference in our hands. And this
quietly sneaks in two lessons from economics: opportunity cost, and prioritisation. 

[^graphs]:
    Although I'm delighted to see that the two graphs that sold *me* on
    effective altrusim made it in: the graph of the global income distribution,
    and the graph of the varying effectiveness of medical interventions. For my
    money, the key insights are inherent in those two graphs.

The hardest lesson is opporunity cost. Whatever we do, we do *not* do something 
else, and as a result of that, people may die. That's a bitter pill to swallow,
and it's unsurprisingly a conclusion that people resist. This is why the analogy
with triage is inspired - it harnessess powerful moral intuitions in the right
direction. A key part of getting people on board with effective altruism is to
get them to accept the reality of their own power in the world today (and hence
the rather overwhelming opportunity cost that they will almost always face)
without appearing to push the unattainable moral ideal of donating everything
one owns. MacAskill does a good job of this, focussing on the positive
*opportunity* that we have to do more good with our resources.

Triage also teaches us that, with our finite resources, we simply have to
prioritise. That means that we will have to leave some people on the hospital
floor. Taken seriously, this nixes the thought that effective altruists "don't
care" about people in first-world countries. It's *awful* that we have to leave
some work undone, but that can't stop us from doing the most effective things
first. Seen through the lens of triage, I think the moral case is very
convincing.

While MacAskill uses powerful examples to support his moral arguments, many of
the other examples are designed to subvert the reader's intuitions. The first
chapter is a devastating critique of the "PlayPump" - a charitable intervention that
*seemed* wonderful, but ended up as anything but. As you read, it's easy
 to think that this is going to be a success story. The impassioned founder, the
 innovative idea, the heavyweight backing: it all sounds good. Until MacAskill
 points out the fundamental problem: it doesn't work. And you can't tell that
 without testing it. The message throughout is clear: while your intuitions may
 be a guide to the right choice when you have all the facs, they can't tell you
 those facts themselves, so there's no substitute for doing your research and running
 the numbers.
 
The rest of the first half is devoted to motivating other aspects of the core
approach: neglectedness, counterfactual reasoning, and reasoning under
uncertainty. By and large, however, these are refinements to how we approach
effectiveness, and I expect the reader will either have been sold on the core
approach by this point, or not at all. That's not to say that there aren't
tricky corners: embracing the possibility of low-probability high-impact
interventions leads us towards existential risk mitigation, which can be a hard
cause to love.

The second half of the book plays out the consequences. The insights here may
seem obvious to those of us who've heard it all before, but they're presented as
forcefully as ever. The almost mis-placed emphasis on administrative
overhead that used to dominate charity assessment is effectively skewered. We
are encouraged to think critically about what the people we're helping would
actually *want*. The ethical aspect of career choice is re-evaluated. And
finally the doors are thrown open to the speculative frontiers, where we might
find opportunities that are even more drastically effective than our current
best alternatives.

Throughout, MacAskill does a fine job of presenting the positive spirit of
effective altruism. While it can seem at times like an abstruse, intellectualized
movement, MacAskill reminds us that ultimately, the only reason we're in this
game is to improve people's lives. We all want to do good, but effective
altruism would really like to do good *beter*.
