The cryptographer glistens wetly in his hand. You stare, transfixed, as his
words wash over you.

"... neural-net learning algorithms, so it's totally future-proof; real end-to-end encryption like nothing else ..."

Finally, something you understand. "But I've already *got* end-to-end encryption," you
assert, struggling to keep the whine out of your voice. You gesture at the lump
by your temple, the bioelectric silicon responsible for decrypting incoming
messages just in time to project them on your retinas.

"Well, it depends where you think the 'end' is, right? Back when they fitted you
with that dinosaur, we thought displaying onto the retina was pretty damn close
to the end point. Now, well, it's near impossible to keep anything on
electronics secure, and there's probably a nanobot filming the surface of your
retina right now. No, we need to go to the *real* end," and he points right
between your eyes.

You remember when you got the lump. You'd just joined the Service, and out of
some bizarre machismo you opted not to take the knockout pill. Of course, you
couldn't see anything, but the scent of your own powdered cranium has stuck with
you.

Seeing your hesitation, he changes tack, tossing the cryptographer at
you. It's not a hard throw, and you catch the disgusting(ly expensive) blob without
even thinking about it. It squirms slightly, and you imagine hooks worming out,
digging their way into your synapses.

"Look, how did you catch that? Did you think about it? Did you solve the
differential equations in your head? No? That's because Mama Evolution is
looking out for you, and somewhere in that noggin of yours is a bit of
specialised wetware for effortlessly handling trajectory calculations. It
doesn't feel like that to you - you just catch the ball! - but no other animals are as
good at throwing as we are. Monkeys may love throwing shit, but they sure
can't bring down a running gazelle.

"That's what this is about. Mama doesn't understand cryptography, but we do.
When you have this in, memorize a few keys and encrypted text will just look
*obvious* to you. Like reading. And you can write it just as easily. It's like
 growing a whole new sense.
 
"Plus, you need it to keep the spooks out. Unless they figure out how to read our brains
directly, at which point..." 

A crooked grin, a throat-slitting gesture.

You know you need this. He knows you need this. You sigh.

"So, are you still drilling holes in the side of people's heads?" you ask, casually.

"Nah, these days we mostly go in up the nostril."
