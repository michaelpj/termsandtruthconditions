"Personhood" is a pretty overloaded word.
[This fascinating article](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/personhood-a-game-for-two-or-more-players/)
makes a case for a notion of personhood based around the implicit social
contract that is required for a person to be welcome and conduct themselves in
the society of other persons.[^recursion]

[^recursion]: The "recursive" nature of this definition is intentional. Read the article.

I think this is a fruitful line of thought, and I want to push it a bit.

## Performative personhood

I'm going to call the contractual definition of personhood presented by Kevin
"performative personhood", since it consists of performing in accordance
with a particular role.

As a reminder, here are the requirements that Kevin suggests you need for
performative personhood:

- Identifiability: you must be recognizable and connected to your social reputation.
- Integrity: you must act as a consistent agent.
- Reasonableness: you must place your actions and those of others in the
space of reasons.
    - Legibility: you must give reasons for your actions.
    - Amenability: you must (sometimes) accept reasons from others for their actions.
- Standing: you must have social capital or some other stake at risk if you
behave outside the contract.
- Autonomy: you must not be controlled by another.
- Proper comportment: you must attend to your own personhood status and respect that of others.

These are the formal requirements, but the understanding is that no person is
*actually* like this, but that they make an effort to bring themselves closer to
that ideal in order to fit in better in society.

It's tempting to say that "performative personhood" is just "pretending to be an
agent", in the strong sense of "agent". *Homo economicus* is an agent - they have
a consistent set of preferences (integrity) which do not arbitrarily change
(autonomy), and they reliably take actions
which further them (which gives legibility). An agent can be trusted to make an
agreement, so long as you take pains to make sure it is truly to their
advantage.

If humans were pretending to be agents, it would indeed make social interaction
easier. Primarily, it would make others *easier to reason about*. If you know
that Joe wanted a car in the past, you can expect that (so long as he hasn't got
one since then) he will still want one. If you offer Joe a reasonable deal in
exchange for a car, you can expect him to accept.

However, agents without many other restrictions are still not very pleasant to
live with. If the market value of your kidneys exceeds their expected benefit
from your continued existence, then the knives are going to come out. But we can
see many of the remaining criteria of performative personhood as binding us not
just to agenthood, but *civilized* agenthood.

Standing is perhaps the easiest to understand in this way. Having standing means
that you can be *hurt* if you stop playing the game. Putting large, collectively
enforced costs on defecting from performative personhood makes agents less
likely to do it! Identifiability is really an auxiliary to standing - if you
can't be identified, then you can't suffer any reputational costs for your
actions. The remaining criteria require you to treat *others* as (performative)
persons, which shores up the whole system.

## Moral personhood

The big problem with using the word "personhood" for what I've been calling
performative personhood is that we normally associate "personhood" with a
variety of *moral* notions, whereas performative personhood is a resolutely
non-moral notion.

Let's use "moral personhood" as a bucket for the moral parts of personhood.

Perhaps the most critical aspects of moral personhood is being a "moral
patient". By that I mean that your experiences, desires, and preferences
*matter* morally. It is good if you are happy and fulfilled, and bad if you
suffer and die.

Interestingly, there is a performative counterpart to this, which we might call
"benevolence". Moral persons are expected to attribute at least some weight to
the interests of other moral persons. Indifference is at least considered 
improper, and can even diminish your status as a moral patient. Children are
moral patients, even if they lack benevolence, but a selfish adult may actually
be considered to matter less.[^justice]

[^justice]: I think this is a moral judgement based on justice, as opposed to
    the loss of performative personhood that comes from failing to perform,
    which Kevin argues is largely non-moral.

All the other performative features make a society of persons more pleasant for
the constituent persons even from a purely non-moral point of view. Benevolence
makes such a society actually *nicer* in a moral sense.[^dimensions]

[^dimensions]: So there may be two dimensions here:

    |                  | non-moral                | moral             |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
    | **performative** | integrity, standing etc. | benevolence       |
    | **intrinsic**    | basic abilities?         | moral patienthood |

    Arguably we should be talking about *non-moral* performative personhood
    instead. I'll stick to just plain performative personhood for now.

Although moral personhood and performative personhood are logically distinct, I
think they are closely linked in a lot of human thought (we'll see some examples
in a minute).

## Some examples

Kevin makes good points about how the loss of any of the performative criteria can
cause us to intuitively regard an entity as less of a person: masks; slavery;
uniforms; wild inconsistency; all of these things exclude you to some degree
from the society of persons.

It's also interesting to consider how partially gaining some of these traits can
bring one towards personhood.

### Corporate personhood

Corporations score surprisingly well on performative personhood:

- Identifiability: good, corporations are usually strongly identified with their
actions.
- Integrity: medium, corporations often appear to have consistent goals, but they
  can also act very inconsistently.
- Reasonableness: medium, corporations can often be reasoned with (usually by
  reasoning with their constituent people).
- Standing: high, corporations care a lot about their social reputation
  (including stock price), and can be sued or sanctioned by governments.
- Autonomy: medium, corporations' goals tend to be *influenced* by their
  shareholders and investors[^id], but defined internally.
- Proper comportment: medium, corporations are usually good at treating others
  as persons (usually due to their representatives), and take some care over
  their own face.

[^id]: We could regard these as the corporate subconscious.

I think this explains why the corporate personhood debate is confusing.
Corporations are actually quite good at performing as persons, however, they are
almost certainly not moral persons. Corporations are definitely not moral
patients, and they are often highly selfish.

But within our legal structures we often conflate performative and moral
personhood. What we would like to say is that a corporation is the kind of thing
which can operate within some aspects of society like a person (say, in
business), but which is *not* included in the legal provisions that
exist for the benefit moral persons.

### Humanising the Other

Monsters and aliens in fiction are usually not portrayed as persons in any sense. If
they were, I think fewer people would be as comfortable with the murderfest that
we usually consider acceptable when monsters are the target.[^murder]

[^murder]: People are often okay with killing lots of humans in fiction too, but
    these are usually similarly depersonalised: unidentifiable and lacking in agency.

Occasionally some works try to subvert this trope a bit by "humanising" their
monsters. Curiously, although the relevant kind of personhood is moral and
intrinsic (the kind
that means you can't be randomly murdered), this
process usually proceeds by showing us the *performative* features of the
creature.

The [Witcher 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt) is a
good example of humanising monsters. Monsters often appear in difficult
circumstances, but if the player does a bit of digging then they tend to have *reasons* for what
they're doing (integrity, legibility). They may have something to protect, or
an attachment to the human community (standing).

For example, you can save a hunter from some trolls by talking to them
(reasonableness), discovering that they are hungry (legibility), finding them
something else to eat, at which point they release the hunter (integrity, proper
comportment). Some creatures can be entirely reasoned into different courses of
action (amenability). In short, they *act* like people.

Monsters *acting* like people makes us treat them more like *moral* persons as well.
I imagine the average player has a much harder time slaughtering everything if
they take the trouble of talking to them first (I certainly did!). It's tempting
to say that having performative personhood actually *makes* you more of a moral
person, but I think this is wrong. Corporations are a good counterexample, in
that they have a good claim to performative personhood, but clearly aren't moral
persons. I think the process mainly works by engendering a feeling of similarity - we
have intelligent, biological creatures which are capable of the advanced social
awareness which is necessary for performative personhood. That makes them seem
similar enough to us that we are inclined to include them in the moral
community. With corporations, however, the sleight of hand is clear - they can
gain performative personhood through the aggregate behaviour of their
constituent persons, but they can't get moral personhood that way.[^jobs]

[^jobs]: You could argue that a desire to avoid harming a company in order to
    avoid the knock-on harm to it's employees is an example of "lifting" the
    moral patient statues of the employees to the level of the company.

### The expanding circle

Peter Singer has long
[argued](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm) that moral concern
is an "expanding circle" which begins with the individual, and then
"soon the circle... includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of
nations, then all humanity, and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings
of man with the animal world".

It seems to me that the cutting edge of the expanding circle is being forced to
acknowledge the performative personhood of entities whom you had previously
neglected. Meeting people from other countries and other walks of life forces you
to admit that these people have integrity, agency, reasonableness, and
benevolence. Once you have admitted their reality as persons, you have to admit their moral relevance.

The furthest reaches of the circle today seems to be animals. In my experience,
material which aims to foster belief in the moral personhood of animals either
tries to show them as capable of suffering (moral personhood), or as capable of
complex social or cognitive skills (performative personhood). My suspicion is
that the latter is probably the neglected avenue, and is probably just as effective!

## That's it... for now

I think performative personhood identifies a very useful subconcept of
personhood, as I hope I've shown in my examples. We should use it more!
