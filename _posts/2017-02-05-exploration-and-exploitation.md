*[Epistemic status: strongly stated, weakly held]*

When faced with problems that involve ongoing learning, most strategies involve
a balance between "exploration" and "exploitation". Exploration
means taking opportunities that increase your knowledge about how good your
opportunities are, whereas exploitation means putting resources into what you currently
believe is the best opportunity. A good strategy will involve both: if you only
explore, then you will never actually reap any rewards, whereas if you only
exploit then you will likely spend all your resources on a poor opportunity.

When we in the EA community are thinking about how to spend our resources, we
face an exploration/exploitation problem. In this post I'm going to argue that:

1. The value of exploration is higher than ever
2. The EA community is not doing enough exploration
3. Exploration through experimentation is particularly neglected

### Preface: What does exploration and exploitation look like for EA?

I'm deliberately going to leave these terms fairly vague - I'm not entirely sure
that they can be made precise in this context[^VoI]. However, here are 
some canonical exemplars of what exploration and exploitation look like in the
setting of EA:

- Doing or donating to the best direct work that you know of is exploitation.
- Trying to work out what to work on or donate to is exploration.

[^VoI]: If we consider value of information (VoI), then saying "we should
    do more exploration" just amounts to saying "the VoI of this (exploration)
    action is high enough to make it the best option", in which case we are only
    ever doing exploitation.

    I could probably have written this post and only talked about VoI, and I don't think
    it would have changed the conclusions much. However, I find the
    exploration/exploitation dichotomy to be intuitive, so I've stuck with it.

We actually have two additional options that aren't available in traditional
exploration/exploitation problems:

- Increase our exploitation capacity. This represents how effectively we can
  exploit good opportunities, so includes things like increasing our available funds or people.
- Increase our exploration capacity. This represents how effectively we can
  explore, so includes things like increasing our pool of available researchers or forming better
  exploration institutions.

## The value of exploration is higher than ever

Exploration improves the effectiveness of exploitation, because we may discover 
that we can switch our resources to a better opportunity. If GiveWell discovered a
new top charity that was significantly more effective than its current ones,
then many EAs who are donating (exploiting) might switch their donations to that 
charity, increasing the amount of good they achieved with their exploitation. 

"Smart money" (and, although it's less fungible, "smart capacity" like talented
employees) corresponds to our exploitation capacity. The greater our
exploitation capacity, the more benefit we gain from moving our resources to a
better opportunity, and so the more valuable it is to explore.

We actually have a couple of quantitative models of how useful exploration is:

1. Some old work of mine estimating the value of funding the Disease Control
   Priorities (DCP) project
   ([part 1](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2012/10/estimating-the-effectiveness-of-dcp2/),
   [part 2](https://www1.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-11-01/estimating-the-effectiveness-of-dcp2-post-2)).[^reasonable]
2. Peter Hurford's 
   [model](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/151/what_is_the_expected_value_of_creating_a_givewell/) of
   how valuable it is to create a new GiveWell-recommended charity. 

Both of these models suggest that the cost-effectiveness of spending on exploration could be many
times that of spending on exploitation (funding charities), and that the value
of exploration is greatly increased by the amount of "smart money" that can be
directed by improved information.

[^reasonable]: I still think this model is plausible for many
    meta-charities, especially since we think that many of them are drawing 
    from fat-tailed distributions.

The improvement from more exploration may not be a simple multiplier on the
effectiveness of our exploitation (as is assumed in e.g. the DCP model), because 
opportunities do not have an unlimited capacity to absorb
resources. If anything, this makes exploration more important: if we do not explore enough then
we are at risk of running out of effective ways to spend our resources, in which
case we would have to fall back on worse opportunities or just save our money.[^now-vs-later]

[^now-vs-later]: Of course, this is not a problem if we are already planning to give later.

The EA community has recently seen a vast increase in its exploitation capacity.
Not only has the community expanded a great deal, but the Open Philanthropy
Project (OPP) now has the potential to provide a *vast* amount of funding. That means that
exploration (and hence improving exploration capacity) is increasingly valuable, since 
it has the potential to enhance a huge budget.

## The EA community is not doing enough exploration

The EA community has benefited from an excellent initial endowment of exploration 
done by the academic community (Glennerster and Kremer; DCP), and later
GiveWell and Giving What We Can. That means that there has been plenty of
low-hanging fruit available for collection, if we could get the resources to
harvest it. So we have largely been able to focus on improving exploitation (outreach).

That doesn't mean that we haven't increased our exploration capacity: today
there is more exploration happening than ever, with all of the existing
research organizations having increased their capacity, and new organizations
like OPP also doing exploration work.

However, the *total* amount of effort expended in this direction by the EA
community is still small relative to how much our exploitation capacity has
improved. I very roughly estimate the number or researchers doing exploratory
work at <100.[^researcher-estimate] These jobs also tend not to be
incredibly highly-paid, so at a generous assumption of ~\\$50k per person, and
doubling to allow for support staff, that's still less than \\$10m being spent on 
research by the movement as a whole.[^not-jpal]

[^researcher-estimate]: Making some very rough estimates of the numbers of exploratory
    research staff employed by various organizations: I believe OPP has ~10,
    CEA has ~5, GiveWell has ~7, ACE has ~3, Sentience Politics ~3. I don't have
    a good idea how many researchers are employed by other relevant
    organizations across all cause areas, but I'm fairly sure the number
    of full-time researchers must be less than 100.

[^not-jpal]: There is also exploration work relevant to EA that is being done outside
    the movement, e.g. by J-PAL, but I'm disregarding that as we have less influence over
    how that money is spent.

In comparison, OPP alone expects to have disbursed about
[$100m in grants in 2016](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later-2016-update),
and eventually to grant as much as
[$400m a year](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/17/should-the-open-philanthropy-project-be-recommending-morelarger-grants/#Sec4).

I don't have a good idea for what kind of spending ratio would be ideal, but
this *seems* low to me (more precise models welcome!). As a heuristic, I think most EAs would
consider RCTs to be a cost-effective way of getting high-quality information
about a possible solution. But the EA community has spent almost no money on
funding RCTs![^ace-rct] Hopefully this means that we are spending our money
doing exploration that is even more valuable than RCTs, but that means that we
have not even progressed far enough up the curve of diminishing marginal returns
to exploration to reach "doing RCTs".

[^ace-rct]: The few exceptions that I know of are the studies relating to the
    effectiveness of vegan outreach (e.g.
    [this one](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14g/thoughts_on_the_reducetarian_labs_mturk_study/)),
    although those have had some problems. 

## Exploration through experimentation is particularly neglected

From an exploitation point of view, all of these are equivalent:

- Discovering a good opportunity 
- Discovering that a known opportunity is good
- Creating a new good opportunity

In all of these cases we gain the ability to devote resources to a good
opportunity that we could not previously have exploited.

The EA community has so far focussed on discovering and assessing existing funding opportunities, which is not
surprising given its historical roots in charity evaluation.
This is not an unreasonable strategy, even if the opportunities which you assess are
simply generated randomly (as is the case in the DCP model). 

But we might be able to do even better if we can generate high-quality
opportunities deliberately, rather than having to wait for them to happen by
accident. Matt Clifford, who runs [EF](https://www.joinef.com/), a London startup
accelerator, describes traditional VC investing as waiting for high-value "lightning
strikes", whereas an effective startup incubator should be like an electricity
generator, producing value deliberately and predictably. I think we can aspire
to something similar for high-*impact* organizations.

One way to try and create a high-impact organization is to sit down and think
very hard about what organizations might be high-impact, and then once you think
you have a good idea, go ahead and implement it. But we know that this is often
a bad strategy! The modern startup industry
functions [more like an experimental laboratory](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.28.3.25).
Sometimes you gain a great deal of information from actually trying
things.[^continuum] Experimentation has the added virtue that a successful
experiment can gradually transition into a exploitation opportunity as it grows.

[^continuum]: Obviously the best strategy is a mixed one - pure
    experimentation is very slow and wasteful. But if we're anything like other
    domains we should expect to have quite a lot of experimentation in the mix.

There are some organizations in or around EA who are working on exploration through experimentation:

- The [Centre for Effective Altruism](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/) has repeatedly acted as an 
  incubator for new EA organizations.
- [Charity Entrepreneurship](http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/) aims to create new
  GiveWell-recommended charities, and has recently launched [Charity Science
  Health](http://www.charitysciencehealth.com/).
- My organization,
  the [Good Technology Project](http://goodtechnologyproject.org/), aims to shift
  technology entrepreneurs towards high-impact projects.
- GiveWell has a list of 
  [charities they'd like to see](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/),
  and YC has a [call for startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/) that
  covers some important areas.
- [D-Prize](https://www.d-prize.org/) helps fund entrepreneurs who implement
  known-good poverty interventions.
- [New Harvest](http://www.new-harvest.org/) helps develop and spin out
  companies that make animal-product substitutes.
- Spark Wave, run by Spencer Greenberg, aims to develop and prototype high-impact startup ideas
  and then find CEOs to spin them out.
  
However, I think there is room to do much more, both directly and in
capacity-building. For example:

- Charity Entrepreneurship found multiple promising ideas, but as far as I know
  nobody has picked up any of the remaining ones.
- Charity Entrepreneurship has primarily targeted health so far, but we should
  be doing similar explorations in other promising areas.
- The Good Technology Project is a "technique specialist" focussing on technology startups, analogously 
  we could have e.g. an organization that focussed on starting policy
  campaigns targeting important problems.
- We could create other kinds of institution for systematically generating
  high-impact organizations, such as impact-focussed startup
  incubators.[^spark-wave] This is essentially capacity-building for exploration
  through experimentation - I am particularly excited by this idea.
- We could experiment with VC-style gated-funding models which encourage
  demonstrating results rapidly and aborting failed experiments.[^GIF]
  
[^spark-wave]: This is similar to what Spark Wave is doing, but there's room for
    more work in this space!
  
[^GIF]: The [Global Innovation Fund](http://www.globalinnovation.fund/) does
    something like this, with different funding levels for organizations at the
    "Pilot", "Test" and "Scale" phases.

## Conclusion

As a community, we should invest more in exploration.[^fund-meta] Concretely,

- Organizations doing research, like GiveWell and OPP, should invest even more in capacity-building.
- We should start and fund experimental new organizations.
- We should start and fund organizations that focus on systematically generating further 
  high-impact organizations.

[^fund-meta]: Note that this is a bit more specific than just saying "fund meta", since I'm
    not including things like EA movement-building which have historically been
    considered part of "meta". I think these are helpful, but not the best ways
    to improve exploration.
    
In particular, starting or funding new high-impact organizations does not seem
to be a focus area for the "giga-funders" like OPP, so this may be a place
where small donors can [bet better](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/15g/small_donors_can_plan_to_make_better_bets_than/).
    
Finally, we should start doing this as soon as possible. Exploration tends
to take time, and there is already some possibility that OPP could saturate
most of our best available opportunities. Time to expand the frontier!
