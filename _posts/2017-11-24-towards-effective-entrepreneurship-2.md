# Introduction

*This post owes a great deal to prior work and thought by Spencer Greenberg,
Eric Gastfriend, and Peter Hartree.*

This post is a summary of the object-level thought on what makes a startup high
impact which we developed while working on the Good Technology Project.

A lot of this material is more-or-less obvious applications of EA thought to
startup theory. Nonetheless, it managed to be surprising and useful to people,
so perhaps it is less obvious than it seems. I've condensed the presentation
given the intended audience of this post - there is a lot more to say on many of
these points. This material might have eventually developed into a "guide" to
effective entrepreneurship.

In addition, some of the material relates to how to manage a startup in later stages. We
never really got a chance to try that out, so it is especially speculative.

# What makes a startup high impact?

We’re interested in startups because we think that they might be a mechanism 
by which we can have a large positive impact on the world. But what are the
qualities that we should look for in a startup?

## Impact model

Before we get started on assessing how good a company is, we should try and get 
clear on how that company benefits the world, to make an impact model for the company.

The first big consideration is who the company helps. Usually there will be one
group in particular that you are expecting to benefit. A good way of figuring
out who these are is to consider the various groups of “affectees” for your company.

### Customers

Customers are the most obvious people who benefit (or suffer) from the existence 
of a company. They pay a cost in money and time, and they gain your product in return. 

For example, [Mesh Power](https://www.meshpower.co.uk/)’s[^bust] primary beneficiary group is its customers (insofar as
you think that promoting clean energy over burning kerosene might have
environmental benefits, Mesh Power may also have some externality benefits, see below).

[^bust]: Sadly, it looks like they've gone bust since I last checked, but
    they're still a good example of the principle.

While we can usually assume that people will buy things that actually improve
their lives, this isn’t universally true. Cigarettes and addictive drugs or games are examples of this.[^spencer-podcast]

[^spencer-podcast]: Spencer Greenberg's
    [podcast](https://80000hours.org/2017/10/spencer-greenberg-social-science/)
    discusses some of the ways startups can unexpectedly cause harm.

### Third parties

The operation of your company will also affect people who are not part of the
transaction, or even involved at all. These effects are called externalities.
Often these are positive, in the case of innovation and economic growth, but
they can also be negative, such as pollution, developing dangerous new
technologies, or causing technological unemployment.

For example, despite being a car company, arguably Tesla’s primary beneficiary
group are third parties, because accelerating the progress of electric cars and
storage will help to ameliorate climate change.

An important class of externality is benefits produced by your customers, which
will often happen if you’re selling to businesses or institutions. For example,
disease outbreak monitoring systems may be sold to governments, but the
beneficiaries are the people who don’t get ill because of the government's’
improved preventative action.

### Employees

A third category of beneficiaries is your employees. They will gain pay and
satisfaction from working for you, but will also spend their time. In bad cases 
they could experience physical or psychological harm because of the job.

For example, one of [M-PESA](https://www.mpesa.in/)’s beneficiary groups are among its employees, since
it needs lots of places for customers to buy and sell mobile money, and this 
provides additional income for a lot of relatively poor shop owners.

### Impact mechanism

The next thing to do is to work out how you think your startup will actually
affect your target group of beneficiaries. This is likely to be very uncertain,
especially if you expect to create an impact through externalities. However,
it's better to explicitly write down what you're uncertain about nonetheless.

For example, here's one mechanism by developing a better test for drug-resistant
TB might improve wellbeing:
- Decrease cost of TB test
- Increase availability of test in low-resource areas
- Accurately distinguish more cases of drug-resistant TB from normal TB
- Give more drug-resistant TB sufferers the correct drugs
- Cure more people of drug-resistant TB than otherwise
- Fewer people go through the lengthy suffering of drug-resistant TB
- Increase wellbeing

There may well be several such mechanisms, of course!

Once you have an explicit impact mechanism, that gives you a two useful things: a set of
hypotheses about how your impact occurs, which you can *test*; and a set of stages
in the mechanism which you can *measure*.

Most of these won't be things you can test or measure now, but it's worth
thinking from time to time whether you might be able to measure more of them.
For example, in early development you might focus on measuring the cost of the
test, but as you roll out you might also be able to measure improvements in availability.

## Assessing the impact model

We can apply our usual INT heuristics in this case, although we can pick out some
particular considerations for the domain. These can work both for picking out a
broad problem area, and for directly picking out factors relevant to a particular
impact model.

### Scale

As ever, we care about both how many people we help and how much we help
them.

We should think about maximum scale here: if you could eventually sell your
product to everyone on Earth, that's better than if you're limited to just one
national market. If we think about our possible beneficiary groups, third parties
tend to be the biggest group, followed by your customers, and then your employees.

Similarly, a life-saving product is much better for each person than something
that merely saves them some money.

### Tractability

There are a couple of big things that affect tractability.

The first is obvious: the problem may be hard. Or the problem may be easy, but
making it *profitable* may be hard. And we're primarily thinking about
businesses here, so if you can't make it profitable, you can't do it.

Secondly, you might not *want* to do it. Running a business is hard work, and
you face pressure not only to drop out, but to cave in on issues where your
investors or advisors may not be aligned with what you want. If your beneficiary
group is your customers, then your profit goals and your impact goals are
relatively aligned, so this may be easier. 

In other cases this is less
likely. For example, Uber (may be) benefiting its 1.5 million drivers. But they
are not incentivised to employ these people, because doing so costs them, so as
soon as they can automate them away, they will.

Finally, you might not be able to figure out *what* to do. Even if you can
identify the problem, you may not be able to figure out a plausible mechanism to
actually have an impact on it, or your mechanism might fail to work.

Tractability issues result in two big failure modes:
- The business fails entirely
- The business succeeds, but it has a low or negative impact

### Counterfactuals/Neglectedness

Assuming that you start a business that solves a real problem, we can assume
that someone would have solved it eventually. That means that the effect you
have is the *difference* between those two, which will look like getting X extra
years of the solution. We can call this your *time advantage*.

Generally, the bigger the time advantage the better. If the problem is big
enough, then even a short time advantage may not be a problem - getting a
malaria vaccine a year earlier would be huge!

But generally bigger is better. There are a few ways you might have a big time
advantage:

Firstly, the technology you use has existed for a while but hasn't been applied to the
problem that you are applying it to. That suggests that it would continue to
be unsolved in that way for a long time if you don't do it. 

Counterintuitively,
this suggests that you should stay *away* from new technologies: it is very
likely that someone will try "machine learning for X" relatively soon, so it is
unlikely to be neglected.

Another common case is that the problem requires an unusual combination of skills, knowledge, or
inclinations. For example, you might know about both financial services and the
developing world, while also being altruistic. Combinations of traits are
correspondingly rarer - if you have at least one moderately rare skill, then it
is likely that you also have one *very* rare combination of skills. 
It may be a long time before this combination comes along again, and so if there
are problems that require it, they may go unsolved until then.[^secrets]

[^secrets]: Peter Thiel talks about "secrets" which are unusual beliefs that you
    have which make you think that a problem is soluble, even though the general
    belief may be that it is not. These are another thing that can make you unusual.

This suggests that you should look especially hard for problems that *only you*
(or you and your friend with the other unusual skills) can solve, because that
is likely to give you a big time advantage.

Finally, the incentives to solve the problem may be lacking (e.g. the customers
are poor). This is a tough case, because those incentives will also be lacking
for *you*. So you need a good story about how you are going to keep your impact
on track. Many benefits to third parties have this form. Often if the
externality is innovation then a strong founder can ensure that most of the
benefit is produced before they are phased out. For example, Tesla has chosen to
give away their patents for free, which might not have happened with a less
altruistic CEO.
