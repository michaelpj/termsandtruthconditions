Everyone seemed to be very excited about *Sapiens*, Yuval Harari's previous
book, and I *do* like futurism, so I thought I'd give this a shot.

Firstly, it's well-written. Harari's style is engaging and direct. And when I say
"direct" I mean *he just says what he thinks*. If he has an opinion on a topic,
he just states it. And when he wants to make a case for a controversial position
he doesn't hedge. Biology shows that we are just organisms following the rules
of nature, therefore freedom is a myth. God doesn't exist, religions exist
primarily as social structures to facilitate cooperation. There is nothing that
clearly separates us from the animals, therefore our treatment of them is
unconscionable. It's a strong dose of materialist history, and I like it.

On the other hand, this means that when I disagree with him, he often provides
little in the way of justification (no doubt those who disagree with his other
claims will feel the same way!). In fact, I often found his analysis simplistic
to a fault, even when I happened to agree with his conclusions. I'm not sure to
what degree this is a tactic to fit more into the book (which is already longish
for a popular book), or whether it reflects his actual thinking, but it's vexing.

Another annoyance is that Harari persists in calling everything a "religion",
including modern ideologies like liberalism and humanism. 

> Religion is created by humans, not gods, and it is defined by its social
> function rather than by the existence of deities. Religion is any
> all-encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy on
> human laws, norms and values.

To which my response is "that's not what that word means". Like it or not,
"religion" has a bunch of existing connotations and you can't just repurpose it.
Harari seems to me to argue that all religions are ideologies, therefore he can call all ideologies
religions. I found this persistently irritating - just substitute "ideology" for
"religion" throughout and it will be less annoying.

Moreover, Harari misses out distinguishing value systems from what I'm going to
call (for lack of a better word right now) interpretative frames. Many
ideologies let us understand the world in a certain way, often involving
entities of its own invention. They may also make some normative claims, which
might involve said entities (or might not). Harari says that socialism thinks
that everybody matters, and that the best way to benefit everyone is for the
workers to own the means of production. But these two things are quite separate,
and I think this blinds him to the possible variety of ideologies there might be.

Harari is also very taken with the idea that our
institutions are *fictions*. To him this points to the human ability to tell
stories as the feature that has made us successful. And he may not be wrong
about that. But an incautious reader could easily come away thinking that he is
presenting a more radical view of history than he is - again, substituting the
word "institution" for "myth" throughout reveals a more prosaic historical narrative.

One thing I think Harari gets very right is to focus on the degree to which
upcoming technological change is likely to undermine *really disturbingly
central* parts of how we think about ourselves. Things like: the individual; the will
(reading his section about tailored advice, I was reminded heavily of the
[Whispering Earring](http://squid314.livejournal.com/332946.html));
the importance (nay, *relevance*) of most humans to the economy. I think he's
hit the nail on the head about the way even our most staunchly
materialist intellectuals champion the biological, deterministic model
of humanity, but then turn around and say "don't worry, liberal humanism will be
fine somehow, hooray!" How are we going to cope with being able to chose what to
want? I don't think anyone has any idea.

This strikes me as an instance of what I think is the scariest philosophical
problem ever: what if we have an [ontological
crisis](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ontological_crisis) 
about something that is at
the root of our value system? Like, say, people? For example, in a world with
uploaded humans sharing computational resources, memory space, and even past
histories, how many people are there? What happens when our person-detector
starts coming up "???"? And that's before we even start worrying about different
kinds of *experience*...

Harari also points out (but doesn't discuss as much as I'd have liked), the
argument that liberalism and humanism have won in the past century because they
were just *better* at running functional large countries. But that's a trend
that seems unlikely to continue indefinitely, and so the question is: will we
inevitably bow to whatever is the most efficient? Or will we cling on to our
current approach?

I don't think Harari has much to offer in terms of actually predicting the future.
His survey of possible future "techno-religions" is especially weak, including
only transhumanism (acknowledging that it faces many of the same issues as
humanism); and "data religion" which is a combination of some reasonable
interpretative claims about how data-processing has developed, along with some
ludicrous normative claims that "data-processing is what matters". I don't think
anyone actually believes that, and I certainly don't think it's a plausible
future ideology. I think Harari got stung by his conflation of value systems and
interpretative frames here - there is a certainly an interpretative frame in
which data is paramount, but I really can't see it taking on a normative role.

Ultimately I just don't think he's thinking weird enough. Barring AI making
things *really* unpredictable, how about something like an [ascended
economy](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/30/ascended-economy/) as a
consequence of the elimination of humans from the economy? And even that's
probably not weird enough.

Anyway, that's my summary of Homo Deus: looking in the right direction, but a
bit wrong and not weird enough. Probably not worth reading if you've already
read a modest amount of futurism, but pretty out there for a popular book.
