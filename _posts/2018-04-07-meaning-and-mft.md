I think there's something interesting here, with my gloss on the interesting
question being: when we intervene in other people's lives, why don't we try
more often to make them *meaningful* rather than *happy*?

<!-- more -->

Let's take two premisses. First, that people often gain meaning in their lives
from being *good* (as Hanson argues policy-makers do). This obviously isn't the
only source of meaning, but it is one.

Secondly, let's suppose that we buy Jonathan Haidt's [Moral Foundations
theory](http://moralfoundations.org/). "Elites" are anecdotally biased towards
the Harm/Care foundation, and thus they get meaning out of helping other people.
But what would it mean it mean to help other people have more (morally)
meaningful lives? You would have to help people to help some third party. Now, this *may*
be an effective approach to helping the third party, but in most situations you
might expect that it would be easier and more straightforward to just help the
third party directly, rather than doing it indirectly.[^wave]

[^wave]: There are some notable exceptions to this. For example,
    [Wave](https://www.wave.com/) is all about reducing costs for people to send
    remittances to their families, i.e. helping them to help others.

Harm/Care is unusual among the foundations in that it's other-directed. The goal
is to help other people, and it does not especially matter how that occurs. In
particular, it seems somehow inappropriate for someone who cares about harm/care
to care about *who* does the helping - this focusses the attention on the
helper, when it is the helpee who is relevant.

In contrast, the other foundations centre on the moral actor themselves. I
cannot be just, loyal, a good follower, or pure for you. You have to do this
yourself, and so any attempt to make the world better for one of these
foundations is going to require getting lots of *other* actors to be more moral.
Which may also make their lives feel more meaningful, if they subscribe to those foundations.

So we should expect to see a lot more morality/meaningfulness interventions from
people who subscribe to the other foundations. And I think we do: the war on
drugs (purity), nationalism (authority), abstinence-only sex ed (purity again),
etc. These are all things (partly) aiming to get people to behave "better". And
maybe this even works: if you *do* think purity is morally important, and you
don't have sex until your wedding night, perhaps you *do* feel like it was more
meaningful. 

So here's my argument for why we don't tend to talk about meaningfulness
interventions: we mostly don't know how to get it, and while we can get some of
it from morality interventions, those mostly don't make sense under the
harm/care foundation.

We could clearly do better than this. At least we should consider cases where we
can empower people to help others, thus hopefully making their lives more meaningful. If we think this is
valuable, then we should be willing to trade off some amount of efficiency to
get this. I don't know how much, but we should at least think about it.

Secondly, even if you don't subscribe to the other foundations, if you can help
people who *do* subscribe to them to follow them better, then that may make
their lives more meaningful, even if we don't think it's actually *morally*
better. Obviously, we'd only want to do this in cases where it isn't actually
harmful: we certainly *shouldn't* support abstinence-only sex ed. But
perhaps we should consider e.g. helping people maintain family loyalties
through difficult times.
