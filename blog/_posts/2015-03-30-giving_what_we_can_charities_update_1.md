I've recently been helping Giving What We Can update their charity
recommendations.  We're going to publish the results as a series of blog posts,
and the first, on DMI (Development Media International), is [up
now](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-26/charity-update-i-development-media-international)!

TDLR: they're an excellent organization who've actually been running a
randomized controlled trial on their interventions, and it's looking pretty
good.
