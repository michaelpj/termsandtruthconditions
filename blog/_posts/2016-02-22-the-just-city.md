[Warning: minor spoilers, but this isn't really a book about suspense]

First things first: I loved this book. It's got possibly my favourite premise of
*all time*, namely that the goddess Athena gathers together all the people
 across time who have prayed to her to be brough to Plato's Republic, and then
 she gets them to actually try and set it up.

This goes surprisingly better than you'd expect.

In fact, that it goes better than you'd expect is one of the things I 
loved about this book. It actually makes an attempt at being sympathetic to
Plato. Many aspects of the "Just City" are pretty okay. They *try* to
do gender equality, and they do a decent job of educating people. And even the
flaws are presented sympathetically. Sure, everyone is allocated their role in
life by an unnaccountable council of elders, but they're fairly
well-intentioned, and actually a lot of people aren't too bothered.

A lot of this comes down to the people, and they're a great cast. How can you
not love a time-travelling band of philosophers whose first move is to go 
and rescue the contents of the Library of Alexandria?
But well-meaning and thoughtful though they may be, they're a heterogeneous bunch, 
and a lot of the conflict comes from the inevitable cultural clashes, 
especially since many of them are women... and most of
the others are unreconstructed pre-Englightenment sexists.

Of course, an enormous fly in the ointment is that the city's masters are all *ex hypothesi*
slavish Plato fans, and they follow his directives to the letter. But before too
long the agent of change is injected in the form of Socrates,
reprising his role as the authorial voice[^socrates]. Socrates is delightful,
and I very much enjoyed how the workers' sub-plot was set up for Socrates to
upend everything by focussing on an unexamined certainty.

[^socrates]: Wryly acknowledged when Socrates complains about how Plato was always
    putting words in his mouth.

But the big theme of the book (apart from, you know, Plato) is consent, both
personal and political. The men (some of them divine) 
struggle even to understand consent, and the women strugle with their lack
of understanding. But the citizens also struggle with whether they've 
consented to the system of governance that they find themselves under.

And, oddly, that's where the book falls down for me. It doesn't quite press its
central theme -- consent -- into the *argument* that it could have been. The
climactic point of the book is the "Last Debate" between Athena and Socrates.
Leaving aside the fact that Athena, the goddess of wisdom, is shockingly
tongue-tied during the entire debate, the central points that Socrates makes are
about relatively minor, contingent problems of the city. The tier assignments
are rigged? Well, they could be made more meritocratic. The festivals of Hera
(randomly assigned mating) make everyone miserable? Then abolish them.

(Or even, as Maia argues earlier, while the festivals may be unjust from
the point of view of any individual, but they may be necessary for the
organization of the city itself to be just - much as Plato would argue that it
is necessary that some do the work of the irons. It's
particularly disappointing that Athena isn't even able to make the arguments
that are made by others earlier in the book![^gods])

[^gods]: Part of the story is about the gods as characters, so I'm not expecting
    perfection from Walton's gods. But they ought to be able to do as well as
    random mortals in their own domain.

So what might Socrates have said? Early on in the novel, we see two complicated
violations of consent. Ikaros rapes Maia, but tries to justify this by claiming
that her body wanted it, even if she claims that she didn't. Maia struggles with 
the truth of his claim, disturbed that her "traitor body" could have betrayed
her despite her unwillingness. Later, Kebes argues that no matter how good his life in the
city is, it cannot make up for the violation of being ripped from his parents
and the life he "should" have had.

Is there an analogy between these two cases, where (more or less) good outcomes cannot overcome 
the injustice of their inception? Justice, Socrates might have said, is
*impossible* for a city, since no matter how well it fulfills its citizens, they 
had no choice over the accident of their birth there. Whether or not this applies to "natural" cities,
 Athena's abduction of thousands of children for her "experiment" is a mass
 violation of consent, regardless of how fulfilled those children grow up to be.

That seems to me to be the truest culmination of the themes in the "Just City".
Not the condemnation of the precise mechanisms in place -- which are shown
sympathetically, and are improved throughout the book -- but the fundamental
violation of autonomy that it represents. I don't necessarily agree with that
argument, but I'd have liked to see it made.

So "The Just City" falls slightly short of what I might have wanted - which is
to be not only a philosophical novel, but a work of philosophy - only
because it already brings so much to the table. Besides which, although I've mainly
focussed on the philosophical themes of the book, it's a tremendously
enjoyable story too. Highly recommended.
